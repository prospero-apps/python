        # The x coordinate of the text input should be equal
        # to the x coordinate of the whole custom widget (which
        # fills the whole window). Let's add a 20-pixel offset
        # to it so that it doesn't cling to the window.
        # The y coordinate should be relative to the right side
        # of the custom widget (which is referenced by root).
        # If you leave root.top, you won't see the text input
        # widget because its lower side will be on the top
        # border of the window and the rest of it will be outside
        # the custom widget and outside the window. This is why 
        # we have to subtract the text input's height.
        # Additionally let's subtract 20 to give some more room.

        # of a widget. We'll add a 20-pixel offset again.

    MyCustomButton:
        text: 'Press Me Too'
        # The other button will be relative to the right border 
        # of the custom widget. Again, we have to subtract its
        # width in order to see it. We'll add an offset again.
        # The y coordinate of the button will be relative to the
        # bottom border of the root widget, just like before.
